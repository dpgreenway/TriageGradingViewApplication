Triage Grading View Application

This program can be run by downloading it into intelliJ and running it through the IDE.

When you put grades into the triage grading analyzer, the triage grades must have total points in multiples of 3 in the
denominator. Without, a divisible by 3 number it wouldn't be triage grading.

The analyzer will not take in any letters or information into it.

The letter grades calculating within follow a similar mapping pattern as below:

A [2.5 - 3.0]
B (2.0 - 2.5]
C (1.0 - 2.0]
D [0.5 - 1.0]
F [0 - 0.5)

( -> not inclusive
[ -> inclusive
